# router

A dynamic router (API Gatway) for go-micro.

It looks for services that host "proto/routerclientpb/routerclientpb.RouterClient" and ask's them for routes/endpoints,
then it registers that endpoints via a proxy method within gin.

## Caveats

- gin doesn't allow to delete routes, so if you want to delete a route you have to restart go-micro/router.
