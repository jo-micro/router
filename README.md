# router

A dynamic router (API Gatway) for go-micro.

It looks for services that host "proto/routerclientpb/routerclientpb.RouterClient" and ask's them for routes/endpoints,
then it registers that endpoints via a proxy method within gin.

## Caveats

- gin doesn't allow to delete routes, so if you want to delete a route you have to restart go-micro/router.

## Todo

- Add examples.
- Add support for Streams / WebSockets.
- Add support for [debug](https://github.com/asim/go-micro/tree/master/debug).
- Maybe add optional support for [auth](https://github.com/asim/go-micro/blob/master/auth/auth.go).

## Example

For now you have to look at [internalService](https://github.com/pcdummy/go-micro-router/blob/master/cmd/microrouterd/main.go#L20) or the author's FOSS project [microlobby](https://github.com/pcdummy/microlobby).
